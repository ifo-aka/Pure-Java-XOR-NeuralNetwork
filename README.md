# XOR Neural Network in Pure Java

This project is a handcrafted implementation of a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, trained to solve the XOR problem.

## Key Features
- No external libraries or frameworks
- Manual forward and backpropagation
- Sigmoid activation
- Java-based AI engine

## Sample Output
Input: [0.0, 0.0] → Output: ~0.01
Input: [0.0, 1.0] → Output: ~0.98
Input: [1.0, 0.0] → Output: ~0.98
Input: [1.0, 1.0] → Output: ~0.01
